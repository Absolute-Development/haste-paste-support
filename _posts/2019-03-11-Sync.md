## Data Sync

Typora store files in `Markdown` format, which is just plain text. Therefore, you could use any 3rd party sync tools, such as iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox and others, to sync those file across devices.

## Mobile Support

We are currently focusing on the desktop version of Typora, so there won't be mobile version of Typora in near future.

To edit files on Mobile, you could choose any Markdown editors that support iCloud Drive or other 3rd cloud sync / storage tools, such as

- Pretext
- MWeb
- 1Writer
- ByWord
- iA Writer
- Editorial
- ... or search "Markdown" in App Store or Google Play.
