## Basic Syntax

- Hyperlink

  ```markdown
  [Link Text](link-address)

  [Link Text](link-address "optional title")
  ```

  Protocols like `http://` cannot be ommited for this type of syntax.

- Reference Link

  ```markdown
  [Link Text][Ref]

  [Ref]: link-address "optional title"
  ```

  or, it can be shorten as

  ```markdown
  [Ref][]

  [Ref]: link-address
  ```

  Protocols like `http://` cannot be ommited for this type of syntax.

- Autolink

  ```markdown
  <http://typora.io>
  ```

- Auto URL: Typora can automatically detect url link in markdown, and render them as URL link, but please note that other markdown engines may not support this.

  ```markdown
  This is a link: http://typora.io
  ```

For link towards a website, we suggest you **DO NOT ommit URL protocols** like `https://` or `http://`, or it may be interrucpt as relative link by Typora or other Markdown egines, or after  export/publish. 

## Link to Local Files

You could use write relative or absolute path as link address towards a local file, the extension like (*.md*) can be omitted, for example:

```markdown
[Readme1](Readme1.md)

[Readme2](../Docs/Readme2.markdown)

[Readme3](Readme3)

[Readme4](/User/root/Docs/Readme1.md)

[Readme4](file:///User/root/Docs/Readme1.md)
```

Please note that, for relative link address, it will not be converted into real absolute file path when export as HTML based on Markdown's spec. 

## Internal Links

You can use `#` to create links towards any headings in your markdown file, for example:

```markdown
# This is a title

...
...
...


A [link](#this-is-a-title) to jump towards target header
```

## Open Links in Typora

You can use `command+click` (macOS), or `ctrl+click` (Linux/Windows) on links in Typora to jump to target headings, or open them in Typora, or open in related apps.

## FAQ

##### Error "Cannot open location `/abc.com`, do you mean [http://abc.com](#) ?" shows when I trying to open the link

If you want to make a link to local file `abd.com`, please make ensure the path is correct.

If you want to create a link towards website "abc.com", you need to put the URL scheme or protocol, for example use `[link](http://abc.com)`. 

Sometimes, protocol can be omitted if you use autolink (`<www.google.com>`) or auto URL (`www.google.com`), but this rules variables across different Markdown editors/engines, so we will recommand you NOT ommit protocols in any case for less compatibility issue.
